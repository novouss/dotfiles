## .zshrc Plugins 

These plugins aren't available out of the box, you'll have to manually place the plugins inside the `.oh-my-zsh/custom/plugin` folder and `git clone` the plugin repository.

- `git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting.git`
- `git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions.git`
